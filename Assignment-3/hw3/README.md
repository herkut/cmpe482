# Homework 3
In this homework, you will prepare a Jupyter Notebook report for the solutions of the exercises 3.6.a, 4.5 and 5.3 from Trefethen, Bau.

**Important Note:** For the 5.3, book wants you to do hand calculation, but we expect you to write a **program** answering all the sub-questions from (a) to (g) (imitating hand calculation). 
* Your program should assume A as a 2x2 matrix with arbitrary entries. 
* For the part (b) look at the Figure 4.1.
* You are not allowed to call svd, eigendecomposition, norm calculation related functions from other sources. (However, it is recommended to use them to test your code by yourself)
* You can use determinant or linsolve like functions from other sources.
* Execute your program with the matrix A = [-2,11;-10,5] in the question and report your results.
